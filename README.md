# Drum_Kit_using_JS

This project is a virtual drum kit that allows users to play drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard or tapping on the drum elements on a touchpad or screen. 
The drum kit is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with each drum piece (e.g., snare, bass, cymbals) mapped to a specific key.
By utilizing addEventListener, the project listens for keypress or click events and plays the associated sound, which is loaded from uploaded audio files.
The setTimeout function is used to add visual effects or animations that reset after a short delay, creating an engaging user experience.
This project provides a fun, interactive way for users to simulate playing drums, with smooth animations and responsive design.
